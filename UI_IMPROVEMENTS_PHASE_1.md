```

- Background: #FFFFFF
- Foreground: Near-black with blue tint
- Primary: Electric Blue (#00BFFF)
- Success: Emerald Green
- Warning: Amber
- Danger: Red

**Dark Theme:**
- Background: Deep Navy (#0F172A)
- Foreground: Off-white
- Primary: Electric Blue (#00BFFF)
- Success: Emerald Green
- Warning: Amber
- Danger: Red

### Performance Impact
