# AI/ML Energy Forecast - Working Hours Fix

## Date: October 17, 2025

---

## 🎯 Issues Identified

### Problem 1: Incorrect Time Display
**Before:**
```
09:58 AM
12:58 PM
03:58 PM
06:58 PM
09:58 PM
12:58 AM  ❌ Weird times
03:58 AM  ❌ Weird times
06:58 AM
```

**Root Cause:** Time labels were generated by adding hours to current time, causing inconsistent and confusing time displays.

### Problem 2: Predictions During Non-Working Hours
**Before:**
- Forecasting 24 hours including night hours (10 PM - 6 AM)
- Showing power consumption predictions when all devices are OFF
- Doesn't make sense for classroom/school environment

**Root Cause:** System was generating forecasts for all 24 hours without considering actual working hours.

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Time Label Generation**

**File:** `src/components/AIMLPanel.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
const generateTimeLabel = (index: number, timeframe: string) => {
  const now = new Date();
  const futureHour = new Date(now.getTime() + (index + 1) * 3600000);
  return futureHour.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', { hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit', hour12: true });
};
```

**After:**
```tsx
const generateTimeLabel = (index: number, timeframe: string) => {
  switch (timeframe) {
    case '24h':
      // For daily, show working hours only (6 AM - 10 PM)
      const hour24h = 6 + index; // Start at 6 AM
      const period24h = hour24h >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM';
      const displayHour24h = hour24h > 12 ? hour24h - 12 : hour24h === 0 ? 12 : hour24h;
      return `${displayHour24h}:00 ${period24h}`;
    // ... other cases
  }
};
```

**Result:** Clean, consistent time display:
```
6:00 AM
7:00 AM
8:00 AM
...
8:00 PM
9:00 PM
```

### 2. **Limited Forecast to Working Hours Only**

**Changed forecast period from 24 hours to 16 hours (6 AM - 10 PM)**

#### A. Updated API Request
```tsx
// Before
periods: 24

// After
periods: 16 // Only forecast working hours (6 AM - 10 PM)
```

#### B. Updated Mock Forecast Generation
```tsx
const generateMockForecast = () => {
  // Only forecast for working hours: 6 AM to 10 PM (16 hours)
  return Array.from({ length: 16 }, (_, i) => {
    const hourOfDay = 6 + i; // Start at 6 AM
    let baseUsage = 0;

    // Simulate realistic classroom usage patterns
    if (hourOfDay >= 8 && hourOfDay <= 12) {
      // Morning classes (8 AM - 12 PM): High usage
      baseUsage = 70 + Math.random() * 20; // 70-90%
    } else if (hourOfDay >= 13 && hourOfDay <= 17) {
      // Afternoon classes (1 PM - 5 PM): Peak usage
      baseUsage = 75 + Math.random() * 15; // 75-90%
    } else if (hourOfDay >= 18 && hourOfDay <= 20) {
      // Evening study (6 PM - 8 PM): Moderate usage
      baseUsage = 45 + Math.random() * 20; // 45-65%
    } else if (hourOfDay >= 6 && hourOfDay < 8) {
      // Early morning (6 AM - 8 AM): Low usage, setup time
      baseUsage = 20 + Math.random() * 15; // 20-35%
    } else if (hourOfDay >= 21) {
      // Late evening (9 PM - 10 PM): Minimal usage, closing time
      baseUsage = 10 + Math.random() * 15; // 10-25%
    }

    return Math.floor(baseUsage);
  });
};
```

### 3. **Updated Descriptions to Reflect Working Hours**

#### Feature Description
**Before:**
```
Predict classroom electricity usage patterns and anticipate peak hours for better energy planning
```

**After:**
```
Predict classroom electricity usage patterns during working hours (6 AM - 10 PM) 
and anticipate peak hours for better energy planning
```

#### Chart Description
**Before:**
```
24-hour prediction based on historical patterns and current usage
```

**After:**
```
Working hours prediction (6 AM - 10 PM) based on historical patterns and current usage
```

---

### 4. **Enhanced Realistic Usage Patterns**

**Working Hours Breakdown:**

| Time Period | Hours | Expected Usage | Reason |
|------------|-------|----------------|--------|
| 6:00 AM - 8:00 AM | Early Morning | 20-35% | Setup time, staff arrival, minimal device usage |
| 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM | Morning Classes | 70-90% | High usage - labs, computers, projectors active |
| 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM | Afternoon Peak | 75-90% | Peak usage - all devices in use, maximum occupancy |
| 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM | Evening Study | 45-65% | Moderate usage - study hours, fewer active devices |
| 9:00 PM - 10:00 PM | Closing Time | 10-25% | Minimal usage - shutting down, cleaning |
| 10:00 PM - 6:00 AM | Closed | **0%** | **No prediction - devices OFF** |

---

### 5. **Updated Peak Hours Display**

**Before:**
```tsx
{ hour: '9:00 AM', usage: 85, reason: 'Morning classes start' }
{ hour: '2:00 PM', usage: 78, reason: 'Afternoon sessions' }
{ hour: '6:00 PM', usage: '65', reason: 'Evening study hours' }
```

**After:**
```tsx
{ hour: '9:00 AM', usage: 88, reason: 'Morning classes start - labs & computers active' }
{ hour: '2:00 PM', usage: 92, reason: 'Peak afternoon sessions - all devices in use' }
{ hour: '6:00 PM', usage: 65, reason: 'Evening study hours - moderate usage' }
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Navigate to AI/ML Panel
- [ ] Select "Energy Forecasting" tab
- [ ] Verify time labels show 6:00 AM through 9:00 PM
- [ ] Verify NO predictions for 10 PM - 6 AM
- [ ] Check that peak hours are during working hours
- [ ] Verify chart shows 16 data points, not 24
- [ ] Confirm usage patterns make sense:
  - Low in early morning (6-8 AM)
  - High during classes (8 AM - 5 PM)
  - Moderate in evening (6-8 PM)
  - Minimal at closing (9-10 PM)

### API Testing (if backend is updated)
- [ ] Verify `/aiml/forecast` endpoint receives `periods: 16`
- [ ] Check backend returns appropriate number of predictions
- [ ] Validate backend uses working hours logic

---

## 📝 Configuration

### Working Hours Settings
Currently hardcoded in `AIMLPanel.tsx`:
```tsx
const WORKING_HOURS = {
  START: 6,  // 6 AM
  END: 22    // 10 PM (9 PM is last forecast hour)
};
```

### Future Enhancement Opportunity
Could be made configurable per school/institution:
```tsx
// Example: Different institutions may have different hours
const workingHours = {
  school: { start: 6, end: 22 },      // 6 AM - 10 PM
  college: { start: 7, end: 23 },     // 7 AM - 11 PM
  corporate: { start: 8, end: 19 },   // 8 AM - 7 PM
  library: { start: 8, end: 22 }      // 8 AM - 10 PM
};
```

## 📐 Technical Details

### Data Structure

**Forecast Data Array (Now 16 items instead of 24):**
```typescript
[
  { hour: '6:00 AM', usage: 25, cost: 0.15 },
  { hour: '7:00 AM', usage: 30, cost: 0.18 },
  { hour: '8:00 AM', usage: 75, cost: 0.45 },
  // ... continues through 9:00 PM
  { hour: '9:00 PM', usage: 15, cost: 0.09 }
]
// No entries for 10 PM - 6 AM
```

### Time Calculation Logic

```typescript
// Simple, predictable time generation
for (let i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
  const hour = 6 + i;  // 6, 7, 8, ..., 21
  const period = hour >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM';
  const displayHour = hour > 12 ? hour - 12 : hour;
  const timeLabel = `${displayHour}:00 ${period}`;
}
```

## 🎓 Educational Context

The fix aligns with real-world classroom/school environments:

1. **School Hours:** Typically 6 AM (staff) - 10 PM (security/cleaning)
2. **Device Usage:** Devices are OFF during night (10 PM - 6 AM)
3. **Peak Times:** Morning and afternoon classes, not midnight
4. **Energy Savings:** Focus on optimizing when devices are actually used
