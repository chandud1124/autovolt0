# Backend Restart Required

## Issue
The frontend is getting a 404 error when trying to access `/api/analytics/energy-summary`:

```
GET http://172.16.3.171:5173/api/analytics/energy-summary 404 (Not Found)
Error fetching energy summary: {message: 'API Route not found', path: '/', method: 'GET'}
```

## Root Cause
A new API endpoint was added to `backend/routes/analytics.js` but the backend server hasn't been restarted to load the new route.

## Solution
**Restart the backend server** to load the new `/api/analytics/energy-summary` endpoint.

### PowerShell Commands (from backend directory)

1. **Stop the current backend server** (if running):
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the backend is running
   - Or kill the Node process

2. **Start the backend server**:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
   
   Or if using npm scripts:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Verify the endpoint is available**:
   ```powershell
   curl http://172.16.3.171:3001/api/analytics/energy-summary
   ```
   
   Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "daily": {
       "consumption": 0.000,
       "cost": 0.00,
       "onlineDevices": 0
     },
     "monthly": {
       "consumption": 0.000,
       "cost": 0.00,
       "onlineDevices": 0
     },
     "timestamp": "2025-10-18T..."
   }
   ```

## What Changed

### New Backend Endpoint
- **URL**: `GET /api/analytics/energy-summary`
- **Purpose**: Returns daily and monthly energy consumption and cost
- **Features**:
  - Only includes online devices in calculation
  - Provides both today's and this month's totals
  - Returns device count for transparency

### Files Modified
1. `backend/routes/analytics.js` - Added new route
2. `backend/metricsService.js` - Added `getEnergySummary()` function
3. `src/components/AnalyticsPanel.tsx` - Updated to fetch and display the data

## After Restart

### Expected Behavior
1. Frontend will successfully fetch energy summary data
2. Console will show:
   ```
   [Energy Summary] Received: {
     daily: { consumption: ..., cost: ..., onlineDevices: ... },
     monthly: { consumption: ..., cost: ..., onlineDevices: ... }
   }
   ```

3. Backend console will show:
   ```
   [Energy Summary] Calculated: {
     daily: '0.000 kWh (₹0.00)',
     monthly: '0.000 kWh (₹0.00)',
     onlineDevices: 0
   }
   ```

4. Analytics dashboard cards will display:
   - **Total Consumption**: Today's kWh + This month's kWh
   - **Energy Cost**: Today's cost + This month's cost

### No More 404 Errors
The error `GET http://172.16.3.171:5173/api/analytics/energy-summary 404` will be resolved.

**Action Required**: Please restart the backend server now.
