@keyframes spin-slow
- Full 360° rotation

- `.perspective-1000` - 3D perspective container
- `.rotate-y-5` - Subtle Y-axis rotation
- `.glass-card` - Glassmorphism preset
- `.transform-3d` - preserve-3d transform style

#### Custom Scrollbar

## 🎨 Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Depth & Layering**
- Multiple z-index layers for proper stacking
- Shadow variations for elevation hierarchy
- Blur effects for depth perception

### 2. **Motion & Animation**
- Purposeful animations that guide user attention
- Smooth transitions (300ms standard)
- Staggered delays for natural flow

### 3. **Color Psychology**
- Blue/Cyan: Technology, trust, innovation
- Green: Energy savings, eco-friendly
- Purple: Creativity, premium feel
- White overlays: Glassmorphism, modernity

### 4. **Responsiveness**
- Mobile-first approach maintained
- Breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl
- Hidden elements on mobile (floating nav dots)
- Flexible grid layouts
