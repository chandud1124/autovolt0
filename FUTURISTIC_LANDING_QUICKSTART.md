## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Can't See 3D Scene?
1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
3. **Verify** you're on port 5174 (not 5173)
4. **Use modern browser** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

### 3D Models Not Loading?
```bash
# Clear browser cache and hard refresh
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

### Poor Performance?
- Close other browser tabs
- Enable hardware acceleration in browser settings
- Use a desktop/laptop (not older mobile devices)

## üì± Best Viewing Experience

### Recommended
- **Desktop/Laptop** with dedicated GPU
- **Chrome** or **Edge** browser (best WebGL support)
- **1920x1080** or higher resolution
- **Hardware acceleration** enabled

### Mobile/Tablet
- Works but simplified effects
- iOS Safari or Chrome
- Landscape orientation for best view
