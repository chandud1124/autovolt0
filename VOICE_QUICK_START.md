# 🚀 **Quick Start: User-Based Voice Authentication**

## ✅ **Implementation Summary:**

Your AutoVolt project now has **secure, user-based voice authentication**! Only logged-in users with proper permissions can use voice commands to control classroom devices.

---

## 📦 **What Was Implemented:**

### **Backend:**
1. ✅ Voice session management middleware (`backend/middleware/voiceAuth.js`)
2. ✅ Enhanced voice assistant routes with authentication
3. ✅ Rate limiting (100 commands per 15 minutes)
4. ✅ Activity logging with user context
5. ✅ Permission-based device access control

### **Frontend:**
1. ✅ Voice session management hook (`src/hooks/useVoiceSession.ts`)
2. ✅ Voice control component with authentication (`src/components/VoiceControl.tsx`)
3. ✅ Speech recognition integration
4. ✅ Text-to-speech responses
5. ✅ Auto-session creation and refresh
6. ✅ Integration with Switches page

---

## 🎯 **How to Use:**

### **Step 1: Start the Servers**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Start Frontend
cd ..
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Login to Application**
1. Open browser: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Login with your credentials (teacher/admin account)

### **Step 3: Access Voice Control**
1. Navigate to **Switches** page
2. See the **"Voice Control"** card
3. Badge will show "Authenticated" (green)

### **Step 4: Use Voice Commands**
1. Click **"Start Voice Command"** button
2. Allow microphone access (browser will prompt)
3. Speak a command, for example:
   - "Turn on classroom 1 light 1"
   - "Turn off room 101 fan"
   - "Status of classroom 1"
   - "Turn off all lights"
4. See immediate feedback and device response!

## 🔐 **Security Features:**

### **User Authentication:**
- ✅ Users must be logged in to use voice commands
- ✅ Voice session created automatically upon login
- ✅ Session expires after 1 hour (auto-refreshes)
- ✅ Students blocked from voice control (unless granted permission)

### **Command Validation:**
- ✅ Every command validates JWT token + voice session token
- ✅ Checks user permissions for each device
- ✅ Rate limited to 100 commands per 15 minutes
- ✅ All activity logged with user information

### **Network Security:**
- ✅ Same WiFi access: Only logged-in users can use voice
- ✅ Remote access: Requires VPN or secure authentication
- ✅ Students can't use voice even if on same network

## 🎓 **User Permissions:**

### **Who Can Use Voice Control:**

| Role | Voice Access | Device Access | Notes |
|------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| **Super Admin** | ✅ Full | All Devices | Unrestricted |
| **Admin** | ✅ Full | All Devices | Unrestricted |
| **Dean** | ✅ Full | Domain Devices | Limited to domain |
| **Teacher** | ✅ Yes | Assigned Rooms | Standard rate limits |
| **Faculty** | ✅ Yes | Assigned Rooms | Standard rate limits |
| **Student** | ❌ No* | None* | *Unless explicitly enabled |
| **Guest** | ❌ No | None | Read-only access |

## 🧪 **Testing Voice Control:**

### **Test 1: Basic Voice Command**
1. Login as teacher/admin
2. Go to Switches page
3. Click "Start Voice Command"
4. Say: **"Turn on classroom 1 light 1"**
5. ✅ Should execute and show success message

### **Test 2: Student Access (Should Fail)**
1. Login as student account
2. Go to Switches page
3. Try to use voice control
4. ❌ Should show "Voice control is not enabled for your account"

### **Test 3: Session Persistence**
1. Create voice session
2. Refresh the page
3. ✅ Voice session should still be active (from sessionStorage)

### **Test 4: Rate Limiting**
1. Send many voice commands quickly
2. After 100 commands in 15 minutes
3. ⚠️ Should get rate limit error

## 🎙️ **Voice Commands Examples:**

### **Turn On Devices:**
- "Turn on classroom 1 light 1"
- "Switch on room 101 fan"
- "Enable projector in classroom 2"
- "Activate AC in room 103"

### **Turn Off Devices:**
- "Turn off classroom 1 light 1"
- "Switch off all lights"
- "Disable projector"
- "Deactivate fan in room 101"

### **Status Queries:**
- "Status of classroom 1"
- "Check room 101"
- "What's the status of all devices"

### **Bulk Operations:**
- "Turn on all lights in classroom 1"
- "Turn off all devices in building A"

## 📊 **Monitoring Voice Usage:**

### **View Voice Activity Logs:**
```bash
# In MongoDB
use autovolt
db.activitylogs.find({ action: 'voice_command' }).sort({ timestamp: -1 }).limit(10)
```

### **View Active Voice Sessions:**
```bash
# API call
curl http://localhost:3001/api/voice-assistant/session/list \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### **Check User Permissions:**
```bash
# In MongoDB
db.users.findOne({ email: "teacher@school.com" }, { permissions: 1 })
```

---

## 🔧 **Configuration Options:**

### **Adjust Session Duration:**
Edit `backend/middleware/voiceAuth.js`:
```javascript
// Change from 1 hour to 2 hours
exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (60 * 60 * 2) // 2 hours
```

### **Adjust Rate Limits:**
Edit `backend/routes/voiceAssistant.js`:
```javascript
// Change to 200 commands per 30 minutes
voiceRateLimit(200, 30 * 60 * 1000)
```

### **Enable Voice for Students:**
Update user permissions in database:
```javascript
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "student@school.com" },
  { $set: { "permissions.voiceControl.enabled": true } }
)
```

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue 1: "Voice authentication required"**
**Solution:** Wait for automatic session creation, or refresh the page

### **Issue 2: "Microphone access denied"**
**Solution:** Enable microphone in browser settings (chrome://settings/content/microphone)

### **Issue 3: Voice commands not working**
**Checklist:**
- ✅ Are you logged in?
- ✅ Is "Authenticated" badge showing?
- ✅ Did you allow microphone access?
- ✅ Is your microphone working?
- ✅ Are you using Chrome/Edge/Safari?

### **Issue 4: "Insufficient permissions"**
**Solution:** Contact admin to grant device access permissions

---

## 🌟 **Key Advantages:**

### **For Your School:**
1. ✅ **Secure by Design**: Only authenticated users can control devices
2. ✅ **Student Protection**: Students can't access voice commands by default
3. ✅ **Complete Audit Trail**: Every voice command is logged with user info
4. ✅ **Network Safety**: Same WiFi ≠ automatic access (requires login)
5. ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and system overload
6. ✅ **Auto Session Management**: Users don't need to manually authenticate each time
7. ✅ **Permission Granularity**: Control who can access which devices

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

### **For Production Deployment:**
1. [ ] Enable HTTPS on your server
2. [ ] Set strong JWT_SECRET in production
3. [ ] Configure Redis for session storage (optional, for scaling)
4. [ ] Set up proper firewall rules
5. [ ] Configure VPN for remote access (if needed)
6. [ ] Train teachers on voice command usage
7. [ ] Create user permission policies

### **For n8n Integration (Optional):**
If you want to add n8n for advanced voice workflows:
1. [ ] Install n8n locally
2. [ ] Configure webhooks to use voice tokens
3. [ ] Build workflows with user authentication
4. [ ] See previous guide for n8n setup
