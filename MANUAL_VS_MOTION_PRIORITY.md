# Manual Switch vs Motion Sensor Priority

## üéØ Priority System Overview

The ESP32 firmware implements a **Manual Override Priority** system where **manual switches always take precedence** over motion sensor automation.

---

## üîë Key Principle

**Manual control = User intent ‚Üí Always respected**

When a user manually presses a physical switch, it indicates **explicit user intent** which should override any automatic behavior.

---

## üìä Behavior Matrix

| Scenario | Motion Sensor Action | Manual Switch Action | Result | Reason |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|--------|
| Motion detected, all switches OFF | Motion ‚Üí Turn ON all | None | ‚úÖ All switches ON | Normal automation |
| Motion detected, Switch 1 manually ON | Motion ‚Üí Turn ON all | Switch 1 already ON | ‚úÖ All switches ON | Motion respects existing state |
| Motion detected, Switch 1 manually OFF | Motion ‚Üí Try to turn ON all | Switch 1 has manual override | ‚ö†Ô∏è All switches ON **except Switch 1** | Manual override respected |
| Motion stops (auto-off timer), all motion-controlled | Motion ‚Üí Turn OFF all | None | ‚úÖ All switches OFF | Normal automation |
| Motion stops (auto-off timer), Switch 1 manually ON | Motion ‚Üí Try to turn OFF all | Switch 1 has manual override | ‚ö†Ô∏è All switches OFF **except Switch 1** | Manual override preserved |
| Motion active, user presses Switch 1 OFF | Motion ‚Üí Keep ON | User ‚Üí Turn OFF | ‚úÖ Switch 1 OFF, others ON | Manual command takes priority |
| No motion, user presses Switch 1 ON | None | User ‚Üí Turn ON | ‚úÖ Switch 1 ON | Manual control works independently |

## üîß How It Works (Technical)

### 1. **Manual Override Flag**
Each switch has a `manualOverride` boolean flag:
```cpp
struct SwitchState {
  bool state;              // Current ON/OFF state
  bool manualOverride;     // TRUE if manually controlled
  // ... other fields
};
```

### 2. **Manual Switch Detection**
When a physical switch is pressed:
```cpp
void handleManualSwitches() {
  // ... debouncing and detection logic
  
  if (switchPressed) {
    sw.state = !sw.state;  // Toggle state
    sw.manualOverride = true;  // ‚úÖ SET MANUAL OVERRIDE FLAG
    digitalWrite(sw.relayGpio, sw.state ? HIGH : LOW);
    publishManualSwitchEvent(sw.relayGpio, sw.state);
  }
}
```

### 3. **Motion Sensor Respects Manual Override**

#### When Motion Detected (Turn ON switches):
```cpp
void handleMotionSensor() {
  if (motionDetected) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SWITCHES; i++) {
      // ‚úÖ CHECK MANUAL OVERRIDE - SKIP IF TRUE
      if (switchesLocal[i].manualOverride) {
        Serial.println("[MOTION] SKIPPED - manual override active");
        continue;  // Don't change this switch!
      }
      
      // Only turn ON switches that don't have manual override
      switchesLocal[i].state = true;
      digitalWrite(switchesLocal[i].relayGpio, HIGH);
    }
  }
}
```

#### When Motion Stops (Auto-off timer):
```cpp
void handleMotionSensor() {
  if (autoOffTimer) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SWITCHES; i++) {
      // ‚úÖ CHECK MANUAL OVERRIDE - SKIP IF TRUE
      if (switchesLocal[i].manualOverride) {
        Serial.println("[MOTION] SKIPPED - manual override active, keeping state");
        continue;  // Don't turn OFF this switch!
      }
      
      // Only turn OFF switches that don't have manual override
      switchesLocal[i].state = false;
      digitalWrite(switchesLocal[i].relayGpio, LOW);
    }
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Clearing Manual Override

### When is Manual Override Cleared?

**Option 1: Backend Command (Recommended)**
Backend can send an MQTT command to clear manual override:
```json
{
  "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
  "gpio": 16,
  "state": true,
  "clearOverride": true
}
```

**Option 2: Auto-Clear on State Change**
If user manually presses the switch again to change state, the override remains active (user is still controlling it manually).

**Option 3: System Reset/Reboot**
Manual override flags are stored in memory, cleared on ESP32 reboot (optional: can be persisted to NVS if desired).

### Current Implementation
Manual override flags are **memory-only** (not persisted to NVS):
- ‚úÖ Survives motion detection cycles
- ‚úÖ Survives WiFi disconnection
- ‚ùå Cleared on ESP32 reboot
- ‚ùå Not synchronized across multiple ESP32 devices

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Why This Design?

### 1. **Safety First**
Manual switch = physical access = authorized personnel
- Teacher needs emergency control
- Fire safety requirements
- Maintenance access

### 2. **User Autonomy**
Users should always have control over their environment
- Motion sensors are helpful but not mandatory
- User preferences override automation
- No "fighting" between manual and automatic control

### 3. **Predictable Behavior**
Clear priority system prevents confusion:
- Manual always wins
- No unexpected state changes
- Easy to troubleshoot

### 4. **Energy Efficiency with Control**
Balance between automation and user choice:
- Motion sensor saves energy automatically
- But doesn't force users into discomfort
- Best of both worlds

## üìä Serial Monitor Examples

### Motion Detection with Manual Override
```
[MOTION] üî¥ Motion DETECTED - Turning ON switches (respecting manual override)
[MOTION] Switch 0 (GPIO 16) turned ON
[MOTION] Switch 1 (GPIO 17) turned ON
[MOTION] Switch 2 (GPIO 18) SKIPPED - manual override active
[MOTION] Switch 3 (GPIO 19) turned ON
[MOTION] Switch 4 (GPIO 21) turned ON
[MOTION] Switch 5 (GPIO 22) turned ON
[MOTION] Published motion event: DETECTED
```

### Auto-Off with Manual Override
```
[MOTION] ‚ö´ No motion for 60 seconds - Turning OFF switches (respecting manual override)
[MOTION] Switch 0 (GPIO 16) turned OFF
[MOTION] Switch 1 (GPIO 17) turned OFF
[MOTION] Switch 2 (GPIO 18) SKIPPED - manual override active, keeping state
[MOTION] Switch 3 (GPIO 19) turned OFF
[MOTION] Switch 4 (GPIO 21) turned OFF
[MOTION] Switch 5 (GPIO 22) turned OFF
[MOTION] Published motion event: STOPPED
```

### Manual Switch Pressed During Motion
```
[MANUAL] Momentary PRESS: Relay GPIO 18 toggled to OFF
[MQTT] Published manual switch event: GPIO 18 (physical pin 27) -> OFF
[MOTION] Motion continues (user manually turned off light)
[MOTION] Switch 2 (GPIO 18) SKIPPED - manual override active
```

## üß™ Testing Procedure

### Test 1: Motion Detection Works Normally
1. **Setup**: All switches OFF, no manual override
2. **Action**: Wave hand in front of motion sensor
3. **Expected**: All lights turn ON ‚úÖ
4. **Verify**: Serial monitor shows all switches turned ON

### Test 2: Manual Override During Motion
1. **Setup**: Motion active, all lights ON
2. **Action**: Manually press Switch 3 OFF
3. **Expected**: Switch 3 turns OFF, others stay ON ‚úÖ
4. **Verify**: Serial monitor shows "manual override active"
5. **Continue**: Motion continues
6. **Expected**: Switch 3 stays OFF (not re-enabled by motion) ‚úÖ

### Test 3: Auto-Off Respects Manual Override
1. **Setup**: Motion detected, all lights ON, Switch 3 manually OFF
2. **Action**: Stop motion, wait 60 seconds (auto-off delay)
3. **Expected**: Switches 1,2,4,5,6 turn OFF, Switch 3 stays OFF ‚úÖ
4. **Verify**: Serial monitor shows Switch 3 skipped during auto-off

### Test 4: Manual Control Without Motion
1. **Setup**: No motion, all lights OFF
2. **Action**: Manually press Switch 1 ON
3. **Expected**: Switch 1 turns ON ‚úÖ
4. **Action**: Wait 60 seconds (no motion)
5. **Expected**: Switch 1 stays ON (manual override preserved) ‚úÖ

### Test 5: Backend Command Overrides Manual
1. **Setup**: Switch 3 manually OFF (manual override active)
2. **Action**: Send backend MQTT command to turn Switch 3 ON
3. **Expected**: Switch 3 turns ON (backend command processed) ‚úÖ
4. **Verify**: Manual override flag cleared (optional implementation)

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### 1. **Configurable Override Duration**
Auto-clear manual override after X minutes:
```cpp
struct SwitchState {
  bool manualOverride;
  unsigned long manualOverrideTime;  // Timestamp when override set
  int manualOverrideDuration;        // Minutes to keep override (0 = forever)
};
```

### 2. **Per-Switch Motion Control**
Allow configuring which switches are controlled by motion:
```json
{
  "switches": [
    {"gpio": 16, "motionControlled": true},
    {"gpio": 17, "motionControlled": true},
    {"gpio": 18, "motionControlled": false},  // Never controlled by motion
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Manual Override Persistence**
Save manual override flags to NVS:
- Survives reboots
- Can be synchronized to backend database
- Provides audit trail

### 4. **Smart Override Logic**
- Auto-clear override when motion stops
- Different behavior for different times of day
- Integration with schedule system
